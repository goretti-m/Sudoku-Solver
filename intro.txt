Title: Sudoku Solver

The algorithm works something like this:
1. Pick empty box.
2. Try all numbers.
3. Find one that works.
I built this python program to help me solve soduku games after my 
first initial attempt. To create this solver, I used the 
backtracking algorithm to solve this problem.

The algorithm solves the soduku grid like this:
1. Pick an empty box.
2. Try all numbers from 0 to 9.
3. Find the number between 0 and 9 (inclusive) that works.
4. Backtrack when the sudoku rules are broken.
5. Repeat the above steps until all the boxes are filled up.
5. Repeat the above steps until all the boxes are filled up.

Instructions
Objective:
The objective of Sudoku is to fill a 9x9 grid with digits 
so that each column, each row, and each of the nine 3x3 
subgrids that compose the grid (also called "boxes", "blocks", 
or "regions") contain all of the digits from 1 to 9.

Rules:
1. Each row must contain all the numbers from 1 to 9 
   without repeating any digit.
2. Each column must contain all the numbers from 1 to 9
   without repeating any digit.
3. Each 3x3 subgrid (box) must contain all the numbers
   from 1 to 9 without repeating any digit.

GUI commands
1. Click on a box. When the box's border is bright red, 
that is the box you are working on. 
2. Enter in a number from 1 to 9. Press ENTER KEY to check
if your number is in the correct spot. 
3. Select on an empty box. Press SPACEBAR to autosolve the 
entire sudoku game.
